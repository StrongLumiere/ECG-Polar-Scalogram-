# Source: Classification of Atrial Fibrillation Using PhysioNet 2017 Challenge Dataset

### Introduction
This project utilizes the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017 dataset, which contains ECG recordings labeled as Normal, Atrial Fibrillation (AF), Other Rhythm, or Too Noisy. The goal is to develop an algorithm that accurately classifies these recordings.

### The dataset includes:
- Over 10,000 short, single-lead ECG recordings.
- Four labels: Normal, AF, Other Rhythm, Too Noisy.

More details can be found on the [PhysioNet Challenge 2017 page](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2017/1.0.0/).
